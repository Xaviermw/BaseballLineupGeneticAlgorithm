Instead of teams, this optimization attempts to find the optimal lineup given the different types of players (additionally, a "triple" type of player was added a Tripette). It turns out that player style diversity does not appear to help and given the rates originally set by the problem, the all Taters lineup appears to perform best in terms of wins (which is the same as the optimal team). Lowering the conversion values for Taters and Moonwalkers (to around 0.08 and .375 respectively), however, we find that the optimized lineup that is found alternates between Moonwalker players and Tripette players (which makes sense, as a Tripette or Moonwalker gets on base, then the next batter will always be able to score the runner if they convert).
